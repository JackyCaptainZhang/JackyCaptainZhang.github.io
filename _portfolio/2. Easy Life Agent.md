## 2. Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: Flutter 3.0+ with Material Design 3 (Cross-platform mobile application)
- **Backend Services**: Local AI integration with multiple providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Baidu Qianfan, Zhipu AI)
- **Database**: Hive NoSQL database for local data storage
- **Additional Libraries**: Provider for state management, HTTP for API calls, Speech-to-Text for voice recognition, Home Widget for desktop widgets, App Links for deep linking

------

## 3. Core Data Models (Database Collections)

- **TimelineNote**: Timeline notes for past events (ID, title, content, category, creation date, start/end time, tags)

- **Todo**: Todo items for future tasks (ID, content, title, creation date, category, tags, planned days, importance level, completion status, completion date)

- **PendingAnalysis**: Queue for AI analysis tasks (ID, note/todo ID, creation date, item type)

- **Settings**: Application configuration (API keys, language preferences, categories, user preferences)

- **Template System**: Reusable templates for common note and todo patterns

- **Notification System**: Real-time notifications for AI analysis completion and data updates
