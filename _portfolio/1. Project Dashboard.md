## 1. Project Overview & Core Features

- **Objective**: Implement a comprehensive enterprise workflow management system that visualizes and tracks the entire process from sales to warehouse operations, enabling cross-departmental collaboration, improving efficiency, and preventing task omissions.

- **Core Workflow**: Each department maintains independent checklists that only department users can operate. Upon completion of all items in a department's checklist, the project automatically progresses to the next department in the workflow sequence.

------

## 2. Technical Architecture

- **Frontend-Backend Separation**:
  * **Frontend**: React 19.1.0 with React Router DOM 7.6.1 (Deployed to GitHub Pages)
  * **Backend**: Node.js with Express (Deployed to AliCloud cloud services)
  * **Database**: MongoDB
  * **Additional Libraries**: Axios for API calls, Day.js for date handling, HTML2PDF for report generation, @hello-pangea/dnd for drag-and-drop functionality

------

## 3. Core Data Models (Database Collections)

- **Admin List**: System administrator registry (editable only by administrators)

- **User List**: User information (username, encrypted password, email, department assignment)

- **Department Checklist**: Department-specific checklists (ID, associated project ID, department, completion progress)

- **Checklist Item**: Individual checklist tasks (associated checklist ID, creator, creation timestamp, completion status, comments, completion timestamp, completed by user, assigned user, assignment timestamp, started by user, start timestamp)

- **Template System**: Reusable checklist templates for departments with default template assignments

- **Notification System**: Real-time notifications for project updates, task assignments, and user mentions

------

## 4. Authentication & Security
