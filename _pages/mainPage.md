# Welcome to the central website of Jacky!

I am currently the 2024 graduate software engineer at JLR (Jaguar Land Rover).

Experienced Software Engineer with an MSc in Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technologies from University College London and a BSc in Computer Science and Electronic Engineering from the University of Liverpool.

I combine deep technical skills with a creative approach to solve challenging problems and develop advanced technological solutions. Passionate about innovation in technology, I am eager to contribute to projects that push the boundaries of engineering and improve user outcomes.

My project portfolio includes improving a smart gimbal for the disabilities, developing an online coding platform, designing health-monitoring smart wearables, and leading the construction of a quadcopter drone and its system.
